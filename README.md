    <h1>Tennis: A Dynamic and Exciting Sport</h1>
    <p>Tennis is a popular racket sport that can be played individually against a single opponent (singles) or between two teams of two players each (doubles). Players use a racket to strike a felt-covered hollow rubber ball over a net into the opponent's court. The objective is to hit the ball in such a way that the opponent cannot make a valid return, earning a point. Known for its demanding physical and mental challenges, tennis is enjoyed by millions worldwide, both recreationally and professionally.</p>
