    <h1>The Exciting World of Tennis</h1>

    <p>
        Tennis is a racket sport that can be played individually against a single opponent (singles) or between two teams of two players each (doubles). 
        Players use a racket strung with cord to strike a hollow rubber ball over a net into the opponent's court. 
        The objective of the game is to maneuver the ball in such a way that the opponent is unable to play a valid return. 
        Originating in Birmingham, England, in the late 19th century as "lawn tennis", it has evolved into a global sport with millions of players and fans, featuring major tournaments like Wimbledon, the French Open, the US Open, and the Australian Open.
